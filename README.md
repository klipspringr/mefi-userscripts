# MetaFilter user scripts

## MeFi replace quote label

MetaFilter's [built-in MefiQuote functionality](https://metatalk.metafilter.com/26605/Better-MetaFiltering-through-scripting) adds a quote button to each comment.

This script replaces the "quote" label with an arrow symbol, for a shorter and more consistent comment byline.

Or, for a custom label, use your browser's developer tools to set the Local Storage key `mefi-replace-quote-label` to the desired string.
